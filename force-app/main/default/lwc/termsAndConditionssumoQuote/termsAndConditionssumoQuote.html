            <h1 style="color:#5679C0"><b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b></h1><br><br>
            <p>Limitations: Warranty; Remedies. Quick Dry Restoration (“Company”) warrants to Customer (and to no other person or entity) for a period of ninety (90) days that Work completed in the Service Areas in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with standard practices and procedures used at the time by Company. Customer’s exclusive remedies for damages, failure to perform, or breach of this Authorization or its warranty shall be (i) correction of same by retreatment, adjustment or repair, or, at Company’s option, or (ii) refund of sums paid by Customer for that portion of the Work which is defective or not as warranted or agreed, not to exceed the total amount paid Company for the services. Customer agrees that Company does not warrant any work that Company is not permitted to complete for any reason. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY AND REMEDY IS EXCLUSIVE AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER REMEDIES, AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, HABITABILITY, WORKMANSHIP OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY DENIED BY COMPANY AND WAIVED BY CUSTOMER, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AUTHORIZATION. Company DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ITS WORK OR THE RESULTS OF ITS WORK. Customer acknowledges that Company is not warranting or guaranteeing any particular level of cleanliness, restoration, odor or decontamination will be achieved. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Company is only responsible for the specific services agreed upon in the Work described in this Agreement, and Company SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONDITIONS, CONTAMINANTS OR SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE WORK AREAS DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT. Company shall not be responsible for any contaminants on the Property prior to the performance of work by Company, including any defective, pre-existing, concealed, hidden or not visible conditions, and Customer shall notify Company before it begins any work of any knowledge or information that may assist Company in the performance of services. IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY, ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS, OWNERS OR EMPLOYEES, BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OR REMEDY (CONTRACT, IMPLIED WARRANTY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY) FOR ANY PUNITIVE, ANTICIPATED OR LOST PROFITS, OR INCIDENT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK, THIS AUTHORIZATION, WARRANTY OR ANY SERVICES PERFORMED BY COMPANY. As a condition to bringing suit to enforce Company’s obligations hereunder, Customer must give Company written notice of any breach or failure of Company within 30 days of its discovery. This warranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect in the event Customer or any person or entity other than Company attempts or undertakes to remedy any of the Work claimed to be not as warranted or represented without first giving Company written notice of such claim and a reasonable opportunity to correct same.<br><br>

2. Safety. Company may use high velocity air movers (fans) and dehumidifiers may be used on the property to increase the rate of drying. Company may also use tackless strips for electricity. Customer understands that this equipment can cause harm if not treated properly. Customer agrees to keep children away from the Company’s equipment and the areas being treated. Customer further understands that the equipment cannot be moved safely without first turning off and unplugging the equipment. Customer further understands that work areas may be unsafe due to moisture and damaged areas that have not been restored.<br><br>

3. Company Not Licensed for Mold Remediation. Customer understands that neither the Company nor its employees or owners are licensed mold remediators under subchapter 295.300 of the Texas Occupations Code, and Customer acknowledges that neither the Company nor its employees or owners have held themselves out to be licensed to assess or remediate mold conditions. However, “[a] person is not required to be licensed under this subchapter to perform mold remediation in an area in which Page 4 the mold contamination for the project affects a total surface area of less than 25 contiguous square feet.” Tex. Occupations Code § 295.303(b).<br><br>

4. Invoicing and Payment. Company will submit to Customer or Customer’s insurance company an invoice setting forth the total amount due. Company reserves the right to invoice at any of the following times, based on Company’s sole discretion, (i) in advance of performance of Work based upon estimates submitted to Customer or Customer’s adjuster or other insurance company representative; (ii) periodically during the progress of Work for any portion upon completion; and (iii) upon completion of the Work. Customer also agrees to pay for any additional charges incurred for other services performed at Customer’s request not included on any pre-estimate or invoice, less previous payments received. For invoices on portions of the Work priced on a lump sum basis, the amount due shall be the percentage of such work completed times the lump sum price. For invoices on portions of the Work priced on a time and materials basis unit price or usual and customary charges, the amount due shall be in accordance with Rate Schedule for labor, materials, and equipment and subcontract services utilized in performance of the work, until pricing schedule or such other usual and customary rate used by Company at the time those services are rendered. Customer or Customer’s insurance company shall pay the full amount due upon receipt of each invoice. Interest shall accrue on payments not received within twenty (20) days from the due date of each invoice at the lesser of (i) the maximum lawful interest rate, (ii), one and one-half percent (11 2%) per month, or (iii) eighteen percent (18%) per annum provided, however, nothing herein shall require the payment or permit the collection of interest in any amount in excess of the maximum permitted by applicable state or federal law in the appropriate jurisdiction. It is the express intent of all the parties to comply with the applicable usury laws, and the parties agree that any excess interest received shall be credited to Customer’s principal balance or paid, if no balance, upon written notice of such excess payment. In addition to the prices charged, Customer agrees to pay all taxes that may be levied upon or incurred on the above-described goods, materials, labor and services by any federal, state or local government and to reimburse Company for the amount incurred.<br><br>

5. Deposits. Company may require a deposit be paid for some portions or all of the Work to be performed. If Customer terminates this agreement or refuses to permit Company to begin performance of any portion of the Work for which a deposit has been paid, Customer agrees that Company shall retain the deposit as liquidated damages. The parties agree that Company will incur damages as a result of allocating personnel and other resources to perform the Work and that the damages to Company by not being able to perform such work is inherently difficult to quantify insofar as Company may otherwise be unable to utilize the personnel and other resources allocated for the Work. The parties further stipulate that the forfeiture of such deposit is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable measure of damages Company would likely incur if not permitted to perform the Work. This paragraph applies only if Customer refuses to permit Company to begin performance of a portion of the Work for which a deposit has been paid.<br><br>

6. Completion Certificates. Customer agrees to inspect Work upon its completion or any segment thereof and Customer agrees to notify Company in writing of any claim, damage, defects, deficiencies, or failures in performance within 30 days of the earlier of completion of Work or invoicing of partial performance. To the extent that they may validly do so, the parties agree that Work will be deemed to be fully accepted without defect if notice required herein is not received by Company within 30 days of completion of Work. Customer agrees to acknowledge in writing completion of Work that has been performed satisfactorily upon request by Company.</p>
